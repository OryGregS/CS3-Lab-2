To use this program, run "Assignment2Main". You will get a pop-up message explaining what the program does. 
Then you will be prompted to either manually enter a string, or to read strings from a file. 

	If you choose to enter a string, you will then be prompted to enter it. 
	Then you will choose to see the results using a stack, a queue, or both.

	If you choose to read a file, you will then be prompted to enter the filepath.
	Then you will choose to see the results using a stack, a queue, or both.

The program will then ask you if you want to continue. 
If you enter "yes", the program will cycle through again.
Otherwise, the program will exit.

Happy balancing!
